## Platform Overview

ClearView™ is a modular, extensible system designed to aggregate, organize, and present veterinary licensee records from multiple official jurisdictions. Think of it as a digital library or universal table of contents for veterinary licensees, where each region is a “chapter” and every licensee is an “entry” within that chapter.

- **Unified Access Point:** Browse or search licensees across regions in one modern portal.
- **Composable Data Pipeline:** Integrates TXT, CSV, JSON, PDF, HTML, and API sources with normalization and caching.
- **Pluggable Jurisdictions:** Rapidly add or update state/province modules.
- **API-First & Developer Ready:** Use robust REST endpoints to integrate ClearView™ into your workflows.
- **Security-Focused:** End-to-end encryption, audit logs, and role-based access.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> ClearView™ is an aggregation and indexing platform for veterinary licensee data. It does **not** issue, interpret, or validate credentials. All information is sourced from official regional licensing boards and presented for lookup and discovery purposes only. For official credentialing or legal validation, always consult the relevant board or authority.

## Current Capabilities (v0.1.0)

- **Supported Regions:**  
  - **US States:** Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, New Mexico  
  - **Canadian Provinces:** Alberta, British Columbia  
  *(11 actively integrated regions; modular codebase supports rapid scaling)*

- **Data Freshness:**  
  Data is collected from official sources and refreshed regularly (not real-time yet).

- **Key Features:**  
  - Unified, multi-region searchable index of licensees
  - Batch and individual lookup
  - Downloadable audit/reporting data
  - Responsive interface and robust REST API for developers

## How It Works (System Flow)

1. **User/API Input:** Select a region, enter search criteria.
2. **Dynamic Routing:** System detects jurisdiction and routes to the correct module.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Module fetches and processes data (cached, scheduled sync, or API/HTML/PDF ingest).
4. **Normalization:** Data is harmonized and organized for consistency.
5. **Response/Export:** Unified results are returned for UI or API consumption.
