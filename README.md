```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

TBD Price Point: $95/Month for Commerical License, $48/Month for Individual License.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# ClearView VetID App â€“ Project Structure Overview

This document explains the context and purpose of the main files and folders within the `app` directory of the ClearView VetID project.

---

## Overview

ClearView VetID is a Next.js application that provides a unified portal for searching and verifying veterinary licenses across multiple states and provinces. The app is structured to support a modular, scalable approach for integrating new jurisdictions and data sources.

## Key Files and Their Roles

### 1. **app/page.tsx**
- The main landing page.
- Handles user input for state selection, vet name, and license number.
- Displays search results using `VetResultCard`.

### 2. **app/layout.tsx**
- Root layout for the app.
- Applies global styles and wraps all pages/components.

### 3. **app/globals.css**
- Global CSS styles for the app.

---

### 4. **app/api/verify/**

#### **Purpose:**
- Contains all backend logic for verifying veterinary licenses.
- Each state/province has its own subfolder for modularity.

#### **Key Files:**

- **index.ts, logicIndex.ts, searchLogic.ts**
  - Provide dynamic routing and logic selection for different states.

- **<state>/logic.ts**
  - Contains the logic for fetching, filtering, and formatting license data for a specific state.
  - Handles data source differences (e.g., local JSON, remote API, HTML scraping).
  - Exports a `verify` function that takes search parameters and returns a standardized result array.

- **<state>/route.ts**
  - Next.js API route handler for the state.
  - Receives HTTP requests, parses query parameters, and calls the corresponding `verify` function from `logic.ts`.
  - Returns the filtered results as JSON.

- **<state>/VET.json** (or similar)
  - Local cache of license data for the state, generated by a conversion script.
  - Used for fast, offline, or rate-limited lookups.

- **<state>/convert.ts / convert.js**
  - Scripts to convert raw data files (e.g., tab-delimited TXT) into JSON for use by the app.

---

### 5. **app/components/**

- **LicenseNumberInput.tsx, VetNameInput.tsx**
  - Input components for license number and vet name.

- **StateSelector.tsx**
  - Dropdown for selecting the state/province to search.

- **VetResultCard.tsx**
  - Displays a single vet license result, showing name, status, license number, and expiration.
  - Colors the card based on status (e.g., green for "Active").

- **Project/Header.tsx, Project/Refinement.tsx**
  - UI components for the app header and search refinement controls.

---

### 6. **app/types/vet-result.ts**
- TypeScript type definition for the standardized vet license result object returned by all state logic files.

---

## Data Flow

1. **User Input:**  
   User selects a state and enters search criteria on the main page.

2. **API Request:**  
   The frontend sends a request to `/api/verify/<state>?firstName=...&lastName=...&licenseNumber=...`.

3. **Route Handler:**  
   The corresponding `route.ts` receives the request, parses parameters, and calls the `verify` function in `logic.ts`.

4. **Logic Processing:**  
   The `logic.ts` fetches and filters data (from a local JSON file, remote API, or HTML), returning results in a standardized format.

5. **Frontend Display:**  
   The results are rendered as cards using `VetResultCard.tsx`.

---

## Adding a New State

1. Create a new folder under `app/api/verify/<state>/`.
2. Add a `logic.ts` file with a `verify` function for that state's data source.
3. Add a `route.ts` file that calls the `verify` function.
4. (Optional) Add a conversion script and a local JSON data file if needed.

---

## Example: Missouri

- **logic.ts:** Fetches and filters data from a GitHub-hosted JSON file.
- **route.ts:** Handles API requests and returns filtered results.
- **convert.ts/js:** Converts raw state TXT data to JSON for use by the app.

---

## Example: Colorado, Connecticut

- Similar structure to Missouri, but field names and filtering logic may differ based on the state's data format.

---

## Example: Delaware, Florida

- These states require proxying POST requests to a remote API and parsing the response (often HTML or JSON).
- The logic file handles the POST and parsing; the route file acts as a proxy.

---

## Summary

- **Modular:** Each state is self-contained for easy maintenance and expansion.
- **Consistent:** All logic returns results in the same format for frontend display.
- **Flexible:** Supports local files, remote APIs, and HTML scraping as needed.

---
