## TL;DR

ClearView™ aggregates veterinary licensee data from multiple official jurisdictions into a single, searchable platform.  
- **NOT** a credentialing service—just an organized portal for public records.
- Currently supports **11 regions** (9 US states, 2 Canadian provinces).
- For lookup, research, HR/compliance, and developer integration.
- All data comes directly from regional boards, refreshed regularly (not real-time).
- Free to try: [Live Demo](https://clear-view-two.vercel.app/) • [Evaluation](https://bordevtech.github.io/ClearView/)

## Platform Overview

ClearView™ is a modular, extensible system designed to aggregate, organize, and present veterinary licensee records from multiple official jurisdictions. Think of it as a digital library or universal table of contents for veterinary licensees, where each region is a “chapter” and every licensee is an “entry” within that chapter.

- **Unified Access Point:** Browse or search licensees across regions in one modern portal.
- **Composable Data Pipeline:** Integrates TXT, CSV, JSON, PDF, HTML, and API sources with normalization and caching.
- **Pluggable Jurisdictions:** Rapidly add or update state/province modules.
- **API-First & Developer Ready:** Use robust REST endpoints to integrate ClearView™ into your workflows.
- **Security-Focused:** End-to-end encryption, audit logs, and role-based access.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> ClearView™ is an aggregation and indexing platform for veterinary licensee data. It does **not** issue, interpret, or validate credentials. All information is sourced from official regional licensing boards and presented for lookup and discovery purposes only. For official credentialing or legal validation, always consult the relevant board or authority.

## Current Capabilities (v0.1.0)

- **Supported Regions:**  
  - **US States:** Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, New Mexico  
  - **Canadian Provinces:** Alberta, British Columbia  
  *(11 actively integrated regions; modular codebase supports rapid scaling)*

- **Data Freshness:**  
  Data is collected from official sources and refreshed regularly (not real-time yet).

- **Key Features:**  
  - Unified, multi-region searchable index of licensees
  - Batch and individual lookup
  - Downloadable audit/reporting data
  - Responsive interface and robust REST API for developers

## How It Works (System Flow)

1. **User/API Input:** Select a region, enter search criteria.
2. **Dynamic Routing:** System detects jurisdiction and routes to the correct module.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Module fetches and processes data (cached, scheduled sync, or API/HTML/PDF ingest).
4. **Normalization:** Data is harmonized and organized for consistency.
5. **Response/Export:** Unified results are returned for UI or API consumption.

## FAQ

### Is ClearView™ a credentialing or validation service?
No. ClearView™ aggregates and presents licensee data from official sources, but does not itself issue, interpret, or validate licenses. For official or legal credentialing, always consult the relevant state or provincial board.

### How is ClearView™ useful for HR/compliance?
It centralizes multi-region licensee lookup, enables batch checking, and provides downloadable data for audits or onboarding. It is ideal for streamlining research and paperwork, but it does not replace legal due diligence.

### Can developers integrate ClearView™ into other systems?
Yes! ClearView™ offers an API for programmatic query, batch lookup, and export. This enables automated workflows for HRIS, compliance tools, and custom dashboards.

### How fresh is the data?
Data is sourced directly from regional boards and refreshed on a scheduled basis. ClearView™ does not provide real-time updates (yet), but aims to keep records as current as possible.

### Who should use ClearView™?
Anyone needing quick, organized access to veterinary licensee records across multiple regions: HR professionals, compliance officers, researchers, developers, and veterinary organizations.

### Can I request my region or a new feature?
Absolutely! [Use our feedback form](https://github.com/BorDevTech/ClearView/issues/new/choose) to request a new region, feature, or report a bug.
